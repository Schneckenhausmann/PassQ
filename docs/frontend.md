# Frontend Documentation

The frontend is implemented in React with a UI similar to Bitwarden. The application provides user authentication, registration, and dashboard functionality.

## Architecture Overview

The frontend follows React best practices with component-based architecture. It implements basic authentication flows and state management, though there are opportunities for security enhancements.

## Components

### App.js
Main application component that sets up routing and state management.
- Implements React Router for navigation
- Manages authentication state switching between login and registration
- Handles JWT token storage in localStorage after successful login
- Manages authentication state with token persistence
- Basic component structure with conditional rendering

### Login.js
User authentication component with master password input.
- Simple login form with username and password fields
- Basic error handling through console logging
- Axios integration for backend API communication
- Calls onLoginSuccess callback with JWT token and username
- No input validation on client side

### Registration.js
User registration component with comprehensive form handling.
- Input validation for username and password fields
- Password confirmation matching
- Client-side validation (8+ character minimum)
- Error state management for user feedback
- Axios integration for backend registration

### Dashboard.js
Main dashboard component displaying password management interface.
- Mock data implementation for demonstration purposes
- Integration with multiple child components (PasswordItem, FolderTree, ShareModal)
- State management for sharing functionality
- Basic component structure with conditional rendering

### PasswordItem.js
Component for displaying individual password entries with favicon.
- Mock implementation for demonstration purposes

### FolderTree.js
Component for displaying and managing folder structure with subfolders.
- Mock implementation for demonstration purposes

### ShareModal.js
Modal component for sharing folders or entries with other users.
- Mock implementation for demonstration purposes

## State Management
Uses React's built-in useState hook for local component state:
- Authentication state management
- Form validation states
- Modal open/close states
- Mock data management

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation (Partial Implementation)
**Strengths:**
- Registration component includes basic client-side validation
- Password length validation (8+ characters)
- Username format validation

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Login component lacks client-side validation
- No sanitization of user inputs
- Missing comprehensive input validation patterns

### Error Handling (Basic Implementation)
**Current State:**
- Console.error logging for errors
- Basic error state management in components
- Generic error messages

**Recommendations:**
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Add proper error boundaries
- Sanitize error information before display

### Data Security (Partially Implemented)
**Current State:**
- JWT token storage in localStorage (functional but not ideal)
- Token-based authentication for protected endpoints
- CORS properly configured for API communication
- Mock data implementation in Dashboard

**Recommendations:**
- Migrate from localStorage to secure HttpOnly cookies for token storage
- Add CSRF protection mechanisms
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Add token refresh mechanisms

### XSS Prevention (Needs Enhancement)
**Current State:**
- No explicit XSS protection measures
- Direct rendering of user input

**Recommendations:**
- Implement output encoding for dynamic content
- Add Content Security Policy headers
- Use React's built-in security features

## API Integration

### Backend Communication
- Uses Axios library for HTTP requests
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080` (proxied through nginx on port 80)
- POST endpoints for `/login` and `/registration`
- Protected endpoints require JWT authentication via Authorization header
- CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests

### Authentication Flow
- Login endpoint returns JWT token in response.data.data
- Token stored in localStorage as 'authToken'
- Username stored in localStorage for session persistence
- Protected API calls include Authorization: Bearer <token> header

### Error Handling
- Basic try-catch blocks in API calls
- Console.error logging for debugging
- Generic error messages for users
- 401 Unauthorized responses handled for invalid/expired tokens

## Styling

### Modern Design System
The frontend features a contemporary design with liquid glass elements and a light theme:

**Design Philosophy:**
- Glassmorphism effects with translucent backgrounds
- Light theme with modern color palette
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Key Visual Features:**
- **Liquid Glass Effects**: Semi-transparent backgrounds with blur effects
- **Dynamic Gradients**: Animated background gradients for visual appeal
- **Modern Typography**: Inter font family for clean, readable text
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: CSS custom properties for maintainable theming
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions

**CSS Architecture:**
- CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Modular component-based styling
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile and tablet devices
- Smooth scrollbar styling for WebKit browsers
- Loading animations and shimmer effects

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Modern blue tones (#3b82f6, #2563eb)
- Success: Fresh green (#10b981)
- Danger: Vibrant red (#ef4444)
- Background: Light gradients with glassmorphism (darkened by 30% for better contrast)
- Text: High contrast dark colors (#1a1a1a) for optimal readability
- Placeholder Text: Medium gray (#666666) for appropriate contrast

**Recent Accessibility Improvements:**
- Enhanced text contrast by converting all white text to dark colors
- Improved readability with proper color contrast ratios
- Fixed low-opacity text elements for better visibility
- Optimized background gradients for improved text legibility

**Interactive Components:**
- Buttons with glassmorphism and hover animations
- Form inputs with focus states and smooth transitions
- Cards and containers with subtle shadows and borders
- Navigation elements with modern styling

## Security Recommendations

### Input Validation Enhancement
- Implement comprehensive client-side validation for all forms
- Add input sanitization functions
